<--> intelligent agent <-->
   (AI) - the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions
   Each such agent implements a function that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to
represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time planners, and decision-theoretic
systems.
  P+- We treat robotics and vision not as independently defined
problems, but as occurring in the service of achieving goals

((coined 1956))

P+- thought processes and reasoning + behavior
P+- fidelity to human performance + ideal performance measure, called rationality
