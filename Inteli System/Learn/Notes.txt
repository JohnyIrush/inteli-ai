-> Theoretical progress  - the kind of progress that goes beyond the progress that practically everyone—including instrumentalists or empiricists—associates with science, 
  ->)) epistemology, the philosophical study of the nature, origin, and limits of human knowledge

->-> observable environment - When an agent can determine the state of the system at all times, it is called fully observable. 
->-> nondeterministic environments - An environment is deterministic if the next state of the environment is solely determined by the current state of the environment and the actions selected by the agents

->-> concepts of belief state (a set of possible worlds) and state estimation (maintaining the belief state) - A belief state encapsulates the beliefs an agent has about its current state: that is, probability distributions for each variable within the state

->))Agents
An agent is anything that can be viewed as : 
P+-perceiving its environment through sensors and
P+-acting upon that environment through actuators
P+-Agent = Architecture + Agent Program

Simple Reflex Agents
Model-Based Reflex Agents
Goal-Based Agents
Utility-Based Agents

->-> representations that an agent can use
->)) Knowledge Representation in AI describes the representation of knowledge. Basically, it is a study of how the beliefs, intentions, and judgments of an intelligent agent can be expressed suitably for automated reasoning
Declarative Knowledge – It includes concepts, facts, and objects and expressed in a declarative sentence.

P+-Structural Knowledge – It is a basic problem-solving knowledge that describes the relationship between concepts and objects.
P+-Procedural Knowledge – This is responsible for knowing how to do something and includes rules, strategies, procedures, etc.
P+-Meta Knowledge – Meta Knowledge defines knowledge about other types of Knowledge.
P+-Heuristic Knowledge – This represents some expert knowledge in the field or subject.

->))  Contingent planning (also called conditional planning). – 
      Handles domains where the effects of an action are not deterministic. – Approach: plan ahead for different possible results of each action

<--> intelligent agent <-->
   (AI) - the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions
   Each such agent implements a function that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to
represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time planners, and decision-theoretic
systems.
  P+- We treat robotics and vision not as independently defined
problems, but as occurring in the service of achieving goals
